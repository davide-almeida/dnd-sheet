description:
  You ward a creature within range against attack.
  Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell
  must first make a Wisdom saving throw.
  On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell.
  This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

  If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.
