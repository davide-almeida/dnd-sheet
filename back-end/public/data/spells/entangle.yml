description:
  Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting form a point within range.
  For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

  A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a strength saving throw
  or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends.
  A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.
  On a success, it frees itself.

  When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
