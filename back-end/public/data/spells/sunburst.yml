description:
  Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range.
  Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw.
  On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute.
  On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell.
  Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

  A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
  On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.

  This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
