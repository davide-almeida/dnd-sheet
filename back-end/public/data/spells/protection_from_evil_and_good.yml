  "Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: \
  aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
  The protection grants several benefits. \
  Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. \
  The target also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. \
  If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, \
  the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect."
