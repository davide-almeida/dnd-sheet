description:
  You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar.
  The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you,
  and can answer in a like manner immediately.
  The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

  You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence,
  but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.
