description:
  Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range,
  draining moisture and vitality from it.
  The target must make a constitution saving throw.
  The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  The spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

  If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage,
  and the spell deals maximum damage to it.
  If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub,
  it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.
at_higher_levels:
  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level of higher,
  the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
